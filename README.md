# Simulation of single phase inverter connected to grid
 This project is all about the conversion of DC from pv to single phase AC compatible to be fed to grid.

 In this simulation, we are receiving maximum power from PV using MPPT(Maximum Power Point Tracking) and using inverter we are converting
 this DC power to AC such that this AC can be fed into grid. This converted AC is made sinusoidal and the current is made in phase with voltage 
 of grid for active power injection with the help of controllers.
